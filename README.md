# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the necessary environment for the examples in this course.

## Setup Environment

You only need to create one virtual environment for all the examples. Follow these steps to set it up:

1.  **Create the virtual environment** in your project's root directory.

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the environment** each time you open a new terminal. The command will depend on your operating system:

    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

    * **Windows CMD:**
        ```cmd
        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```

    * **Windows PowerShell:**
        ```powershell
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
